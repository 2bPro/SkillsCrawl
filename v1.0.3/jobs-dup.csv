Intelligence Analysts use state-of-the-art technologies to collect and interpret information. They provide vital intelligence to support military forces deployed around the world.  Typical Responsibilities:   Collect, collate and evaluate intelligence from multiple sources.   Monitor and analyse radio and electronic transmissions broadcast throughout the world.   Analyse and interpret aerial or satellite imagery using high tech systems.   Disseminate tailored Intelligence to commanders, aircrew or troops on the ground.  Similar civilian roles include Researcher, IT Analyst, Business Analyst.  I monitor and analyse extremist propaganda released on the internet.  I use open source intelligence trade craft to collate and log extremist media released on the internet to understand how it is was published, why it was published and the impact it could have. I would then write up my finding and release a report on a weekly basis, this report would often be used by senior decision makers across Whitehall. The fact that my work has such an impact on a number of operations is highly rewarding. This was also the job in which I received a MBE award for my work, highlighting the significance of the role.  My Day  My job is to help prepare fast jet pilots against adversary threats.  When not deployed on operations around the world, I build and deliver briefings on real time threats around the world, as well as providing intricate details on adversary aircraft, missile systems and tactics to ensure the day to day training is realistic and we are prepared for the real thing. As the dedicated squadron Intelligence Analyst, I deploy alongside the aircraft on all operations. Life on a squadron is fast paced, with many challenges and pressures; however the rewards are incredible. Squadron Intelligence Analysts are given huge amounts of responsibility and are expected to deliver, whether on operations or at home.  Training  Full Time  Regular  Initial Training  Your career will start with a 10 week Basic Recruit Training Course (BRTC) at RAF Halton in Buckinghamshire. The course will prepare you for service life in one of the most respected military forces in the world.

Specialist Training  The next step is a 16-week course in the fundamentals of Intelligence at the Joint Intelligence Training Group, Chicksands in Bedfordshire. The course is designed to train you as an Operational Intelligence analyst and gives you: a good understanding of the sources of intelligence, such as imagery and communications the techniques for processing intelligence the skills to disseminate the intelligence effectively, either through written or graphical means or by delivering an intelligence briefing.
