### Machine Learning Based Approach to Identifying Hard and Soft Skill Demand in Scotland
Web Scraping INDEED for job advertisements with BeautifulSoup for the application of natural language processing and unsupervised machine learning techniques with the purpose of discovering skill demand trends in Scotland. One of the main subjects of focus is the distinction between soft skills (such as communication, ability to adapt and problem-solving) and hard skills (such as technical and manual skills).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

To ensure proper functionality of the files, you would need to ensure the following software and libraries are installed on your machine:  

* Python 2.7.12
* Beautifulsoup
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* NLTK
* Sklearn
* Wordcloud
* Bokeh

### Installing

The project does not need any instalation. However, the corpus and graphs are too large for upload on GitHub and have been added separately on Google Drive. In order to test the code or see the resulted graphs, including interactive Bokeh graphs, please download the file from [here](). Unzip the folder and add it to the root of this repository. Start the Python files via the command line or terminal by running the following command:  

```
python extract-jobs.py
```

And

```
python data-analysis.py
```

The data analysis file requires you to open the file in a text editor and un-comment the functions you want it to perform before running.
